20250405:
please implement a node.js filter for an atop log which extracts performance statistics for an application.
it should accept a pathname for the atop log fine, the application name, and optionally '-b' and '-e' arguments to permit hh:mm values to pass to the "atop -r" command.
an example of one page of the atop log is in the file atom_mdb_copy.log. examples of the process log entry for mdb_copy are in the grep_mdb_copy.log file.

the output should in csv format and each line should correlate the process statistics whith the global statistics
to include the timestamp, application name, cpu_percentage, read and write MB/s, and read and write iops.
the system statistics include read and write operations.
these must be compined with the interval from the header line to compute the rate.

a csv header could be:

  timestamp,app,cpu_percent,read_iops,write_iops,read_MBps,write_MBps


20250407:
  create a new node.js program, extend_query_statics.js, which uses another csv file to control the process_atop_logs.js program.
  the second csv file records statistics for query executions.
  take the query-20250403T142931.csv as an example.
  each line contains a start timestamp, an end timestamp and a result count.
  read that query csv file and for each line, execute process_atop_logs with the atop log file for the respective day or days
  and for the respective time interval
  note that the timestamps in the query csv file are in zulu time.
  
  for each line of query statistics create a new csv file with the timestamp and count in its name.


extend the process_atop_logs sript to include the wait percentage.
this is the last entry in the CPU line in the global section.
and example is
    
    CPU | sys       3% | user      6% | irq       0% | idle   3180% | wait     11% |


implement a control script which accepts a repository name,
modifies the atop daemon's interval to 5 seconds,
runs the test-spo.sh script with that repository as the argugment,
waits for it to complete,
returns the atop interval to 60 seconds and then
run the extend_query_stats script with the current atop log and the output from the test-spo.sh script.

take the set of csv files which that produced and generate an html page
with svg graphs for the respective read and write MB/s and the wait percent plotted in a timeseries graph

the atop configuration is changed by editing its script file at "/usr/share/atop/atop.daily".
the initial value for the line to change there is

    LOGINTERVAL=60                          # default interval in seconds  

please modify the script to edit that file.

please add a mechanism to integrate the content of an additional log file into the query_*.csv result statistics.
the new log file include cache hit and mist statics. the first lines look like
TIME         HITS   MISSES  DIRTIES    RATIO   BUFFERS_MB   CACHE_MB
2025-04-12T11:27:05     2155        0       18   100.0%          121     201837
2025-04-12T11:27:06     2573        0       10   100.0%          121     201837
2025-04-12T11:27:07     1872        0        0   100.0%          121     201837

the log file will be /tmp/cachestat.log
it contains one entry for each second.
the first column is a timestamp.
the third column is the count of cache misses over the sample interval.
correlate the count of misses with the data written to the query statistics csl and extend each line with an additional ccolumn for cache misses.
include the data in the generated graphs with a second scale for it on the right side.

the rest of the implementation now works well.
you should not change anything except to correlate this new value,
integrate it into the statistics result csv and include it in the graphs.


implement a new utility which filters the syslog to extract query match and scan statistics.
each syslog entry looks like this:

2025-04-13T00:15:02.472789+02:00 [notice] spocq[54725]: [T] [statistics] <https://nxp-dev.dydra.com/nlv00294/plm> { <urn:uuid:94068C70-17EB-11F0-8637-B94AD69B2694> :timestamp "2025-04-12T22:15:01Z"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime>;  :agent_id "james"; :agent_location "213.227.138.5"; :algebra_operations 1; :bytes_allocated 5488224; :match_requests 0; :match_responses 0; :name "sparql"; :query_time 784006; :real_time 24000; :run_time 12618919; :service_quality "SPARQL"; :signature "9b8dbc8e953179fa67f173de0469174fce3a8363"; :solutions_constructed 1; :solutions_processed 0; :solutions_returned 1; :user_id "monitoring" . }

the first entry is a timestamp.
the sixth entry, the url, is the repository identifier. of this the last two url elements constitute the name. in this example "nlv00294/plm".
the "match_requests" is the count of statement patterns in the respective query.
the "match_responses" is the count of solutions returned for all patterns.
the average is match_responses/match_requests

the utility should accept a repository name and optionally a start and end time.
for each matching entry in the interval extract the request and response count.
produce a csv with timetamp,repositors,match_requests,match_responses,match_responses_average.
